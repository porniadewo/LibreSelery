Convolution reverb is a process that uses impulse responses (IRs) to capture the acoustic characteristics of real spaces and apply them to any audio signal. IRs are recordings of short sounds (such as a clap or a gunshot) in different locations, and they contain all the reflections, echoes and reverberations of that space. By using IRs, convolution reverb can create more realistic and natural sounding reverb than traditional algorithmic reverb.
  
Audioease Altiverb 7 XL comes with a huge library of IRs from all over the world, covering various types of spaces such as concert halls, churches, studios, caves, stadiums and more. You can also download new IRs for free every month from Audioease's website. You can browse through the IRs by clicking photos of rooms, or use the keyword search field to find what you need. You can also load your own IRs or create them with Altiverb's built-in IR generator.
  
Altiverb 7 XL is not only realistic, but also flexible and versatile. It offers many parameters to tweak the reverb, such as decay time, pre-delay, damping, EQ, modulation and more. You can also use automation to change the reverb settings over time. Altiverb 7 XL supports up to 5.1 surround input and output, and up to 384 kHz sampling rates. It also includes a TDM plug-in for Pro Tools HD users.
  
Altiverb 7 XL is compatible with Windows AAX Native VST RTAS and Mac OS X AAX Native AudioUnit MAS VST RTAS TDM formats. You will need an iLok key (2nd generation or up) to authorize the plug-in.
